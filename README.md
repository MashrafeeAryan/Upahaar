# 🎉 Upahaar App

**Upahaar** is a cross-platform mobile app that helps you never forget a friend’s birthday.  
With just a few taps, you can order personalized gifts, track orders in real-time, and get birthday reminders — all in one beautiful, user-friendly interface.

> 📝 **Note:** This project is the redesigned and extended version of my earlier app **BDays**, which was originally built with a different tech stack (React Native, Firebase, Stripe). With **Upahaar**, I rebuilt the backend using **AWS + Node.js**, introduced new features, and gave the app a fresh identity.

## ✨ Features
- 📅 **Birthday Calendar** – Sync and manage friends’ birthdays in a clean, intuitive calendar view.  
- 🎁 **Gift Ordering** – Browse and order personalized gifts directly in the app.  
- 💳 **Stripe Payments** – Secure payment integration with one-tap checkout.  
- 🚚 **Real-Time Order Tracking** – Live updates on your gift’s journey (ordered → shipped → delivered).  
- 🔔 **Push Notifications** – Friendly reminders for upcoming birthdays + delivery status.  
- ☁️ **Cloud-Native Backend** – Built on **AWS (Cognito, DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, SNS)** for scalability.

## 🚀 Why did I make it?
- Wanted to use **serverless AWS backend** for cost-effective scaling.  
- Demonstrates **full-stack integration** (mobile → backend → database → payments).  
- Highlight **production-ready skills**: authentication, payments, push notifications, and cloud infra.  
- Evolves from my previous project (**BDays**) into a more robust and scalable application with new features.
